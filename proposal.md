# Major Project Proposal

## Description
- A basic and small adventure game where the player just explores that map. Talking to NPCs and doing small quests. There is no plan for a final goal of any sort.
## Need to Have
- Proper Movement system that can detect collisions.
- Dialouge Box System
- Basic Quests that can be done
- At the very least basic markers and symbols to mark the player and NPCs
- Very basic inventory system.
## Nice to Have
- Sprites for each Character. I don't intend making too much
- Possibly a final ending
- Music in the background, probably not too hard to code.
- Possibly 2 characters to pick from to play as, 1 Boy and 1 Girl.
